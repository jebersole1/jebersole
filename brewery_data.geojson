{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "name": "Three Notch'd Brewing", "description": "Originally, the Three Notch’d Road was a colonial-era thoroughfare running east and west through central Virginia. It is believed to have taken its name from a distinctive marking of three notches burnt or axed into trees to blaze the trail. As legend has it, the road was made famous by Jack Jouett’s midnight ride to Charlottesville, VA. in June of 1781. After General Benedict Arnold defected to the British, he sacked Richmond and caused a number of our founding fathers, including then Governor Thomas Jefferson, to seek refuge at Jefferson’s home, Monticello, in Charlottesville, VA. Learning of this, General Cornwallis ordered Banastre Tarleton to ride to Charlottesville and capture the group. Captain Jack Jouett of the Virginia Military heard the sound of Tarleton’s cavalry from his Louisa County home just 40 miles from Charlottesville. Upon witnessing the cavalry pause for an extended rest, he raced the moon-lit Three Notch’d Road to Monticello to warn the Governor and his state legislators to flee Charlottesville. Recognizing their debt to Jouett, the legislature passed a resolution on June 15, 1781 to honor him, and “Jack Jouett’s Ride” became a legendary portion of Virginia’s history.", "image_url": "https://assets.untappd.com/site/brewery_logos_hd/brewery-79438_59e85_hd.jpeg", "ratingValue": 3.743, "bestRating": "5", "reviewCount": 355371, "streetAddress": "520 2nd St SE", "addressLocality": "Charlottesville", "addressRegion": "VA", "telephone": null, "warningservesCuisine": null, "full_address": "520 2nd St SE, Charlottesville, VA", "Latitude": "38.026121", "Longitude": "-78.482181", "City": "Charlottesville", "State": "VA", "Country": "United States", "Brewery Name": "Three Notch'd Brewing", "Avg Beer Rating": 3.0, "Count": 2, "Top Beer Rating": 3.25, "My StDev": 0.35355339059327379, "Global Avg Rating": 3.8, "Global StDev": 0.098994949366116899, "Diff": -0.8, "Avg Beer Rating Without Top": "tbd", "Brewery Rating": "tbd", "T-Statistic": null, "P-Value": null, "OverUnder": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -78.482181, 38.026121 ] } },

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "name": "von Trapp Brewing", "description": "Over the course of many visits to Austria, Johannes von Trapp, the youngest son of Maria and the Baron, gained an appreciation for the crisp, clean Austrian lager beers.  When the craft beer movement in the United States gained momentum in the early 1990s, there was a noticeable lack of focus on lagers.  It’s not surprising, considering that lagers are more challenging to brew, take longer to mature, and are therefore more expensive to create.  For two decades Johannes dreamed of building an Austrian-style brewery at the Trapp Family Lodge, and in 2010 that dream came to fruition.  A humble brewery with capacity for 2,000 barrels per year quickly attracted attention under the name Trapp Lager, and the brewery received requests from all over the United States.  The von Trapp family, who had always been reticent to commercialize their family heritage, realized that they had a product deserving of the family name.  The new facility, completed in 2015 under the name von Trapp Brewing, allowed the family to expand beyond their home territory and spread the gospel of craft lagers.", "image_url": "https://assets.untappd.com/site/brewery_logos/brewery-4157_77366.jpeg", "ratingValue": 3.624, "bestRating": "5", "reviewCount": 169106, "streetAddress": "1333 Luce Hill Rd", "addressLocality": "Stowe", "addressRegion": "VT", "telephone": null, "warningservesCuisine": null, "full_address": "1333 Luce Hill Rd, Stowe, VT", "Latitude": "44.470583", "Longitude": "-72.735174", "City": "Stowe", "State": "VT", "Country": "United States", "Brewery Name": "von Trapp Brewing", "Avg Beer Rating": 4.25, "Count": 3, "Top Beer Rating": 4.5, "My StDev": 0.25, "Global Avg Rating": 3.6833333333333336, "Global StDev": 0.10263202878893779, "Diff": 0.56666666666666643, "Avg Beer Rating Without Top": "4.125", "Brewery Rating": "4.3125", "T-Statistic": 3.631848572413757, "P-Value": 0.022123643723378317, "OverUnder": "Underrated" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -72.735174, 44.470583 ] } },

In the early days, our commitment was so intense that our wives and neighbors thought we might be doing something illegal.\n\nWe’re less suspicious about it now, but no less driven to make the best beer possible. MoMac brews a high quality beer that is as well-balanced as it is approachable. Our first taste testers were our friends and family, and they run the gamut from beer lovers like us to curious folks who are interested in something new. We won over all of them, and we know we’ll win you over too.\n\nMoMac is by the community, for the community. We started brewing in a Chesapeake garage, and are proud to give Western Hampton Roads a brewery of its own. It’s more than beer for us; we want to be a place where the whole neighborhood can have fun. That’s why we’ve got a huge bar, comfortable indoor and outdoor seating, a private party area, weekend shows featuring killer musicians, visits from the best food trucks in town, and – yes – even a place for the kids to play.\n\nCome visit us at MoMac for a cold beer and a great time.
